# Portfolio-4: ðŸ“ˆPython - Customer Churn Prediction
# Description
This project simulates a real-world scenario involving project management data across multiple dimensionsâ€”employee details, project status, and designation levels. Using Python, the goal was to clean, transform, and analyze three interconnected datasets to derive insights about employee performance, project outcomes, and organizational structure.

The tasks involved:
* Creating and saving structured DataFrames from raw data
* Handling missing values using running averages
* Merging datasets and applying conditional logic
* Enhancing data presentation with name formatting and designation adjustments
* Generating summary reports and filtering based on custom criteria
# Skills 
* **Data Wrangling with Pandas**: Created, cleaned, and merged multiple DataFrames
* **Missing Value Imputation**: Applied running average logic using for loops
* **String Manipulation**: Split names, added prefixes, and formatted columns
* **Conditional Logic**: Used if statements to promote/demote designation levels
* **Data Filtering**: Queried data based on city names and project status
* **Aggregation & Grouping**: Calculated total project cost per employee
* **File Handling**: Saved intermediate and final outputs as .csv files
# Technology 
* **Python** - Core programming language
* **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
* **NumPy** - Numerical operations and array handling
* **Jupyter Notebook** - Code execution and documentation
# Project Outcome
* Successfully created and saved three structured .csv files from raw data
* Imputed missing project costs using a running average technique
* Built a unified DataFrame combining employee, project, and designation data
* Applied business rules to adjust designation levels based on performance
* Generated a bonus column for completed projects and summarized total costs
* Delivered a clean, well-commented .ipynb notebook demonstrating end-to-end analysis
